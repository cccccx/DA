Data mining exercise 8! At first I try to use python to deal with this exercise.
However, when I try to get the Document Term Matrix using the sklearn, an error always shows.
"ValueError: empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only contain stop words"
And I cannot find the way to deal with this problem.
So then I use R to do this exercise.
Drop.py let me get the dataset after removing the documents that do not belong to any topic and write a csv file.

Then I use this csv file to do exercise using R


For task 4, I write some code using R to do clustering. However,the speed of 2 models is too slow. Only kmeans model can run fast.For rest of 2 models, R ran out of my labtop's RAM. And I cannot get the final results.

So I choose to use Weka to do cluseter. But I am sure these codes are right.

And I do not write the clusetering results using R in my report.
